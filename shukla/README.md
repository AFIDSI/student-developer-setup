1. Forked repository, cloned onto local device

2. Created new branch "ukshukla" and created directory "shukla", with this README.md file in it.

3. Created basic helloWorld.java program, which prints "Hello world!". added Makefile to build and run this program. To run, type in "make run" in the terminal. Afterwards, make sure to clean out all the .class files by running "make clean".
